# Suresh_Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis
Created an Interactive Dashboard of Suresh's E-commerce Store using Power BI

## **Project Objective**

The owner of the Suresh E-Commerce Store wants us to create an [interactive dashboard](https://github.com/ShriyanshJn/Suresh_Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Suresh_Ecommerce_Sales_Dashboard.png) to track and analyze their online sales across India.

## **Dataset used**

- [Details](https://github.com/ShriyanshJn/Suresh_Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Details.csv)
- [Orders](https://github.com/ShriyanshJn/Suresh_Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Orders.csv)

## **Questions (KPIs)**

- Compare the sum of the amounts with different states.
- Which person spent the maximum amount of money to buy products?
- Which category of products do customers order the most (Clothing, Electronics, and Furniture)?
- What kind of payment mode do customers use the most while purchasing products?
- Which months of the year does the Suresh Store generate maximum and minimum profits?
- Which sub-category of the product customer orders the most contributes to gaining maximum profits for Suresh Store?

## **Process**

- Created an [interactive dashboard](https://github.com/ShriyanshJn/Suresh_Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Suresh_Ecommerce_Sales_Dashboard.png) to track and analyze online sales data.
- Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers.
- Created connections, joined new tables, and calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations.
- Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc.).

## **Project Insight**

- The trio of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh reign supreme as the top three states in terms of Suresh Store sales.
- The Store kicks off the year with a profit surge, from January to April, and enjoys another peak from August to November.
- A three-month stint in the dark yellow, from May to July, tested the Store's resilience.
- Among the product categories, clothing steals the spotlight with a commanding 63%, followed by electronics at 21%, and furniture with a solid 17%.
- When it comes to payment preferences, cash on delivery (COD) leads the way with a strong 44%, followed by UPI at 21%, and debit cards at 13%.

## **Final Conclusion**

Customers living in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh purchase most of the products such as Clothing, Electronics, and Furniture. To improve sales of the Suresh E-Commerce Store, the owner must show maximum ads and offer discounted prices and coupons in the months from January to April and December.
